## HuDSoN repository
This work culminated in HuDSoN.  However, HuDSoN lives now in another repository:

## Introduction
This is the pragma tuner for Vivado HLS developed by Hans Giesen, an intern from the University of Pennsylvania, during
his internship in San Jose, CA between 6/5/2019 and 8/23/2019.  For an introduction to the tuner, please consult the
presentation that is located in the `Presentation` directory.

## Copyright
The pragma tuner is based on OpenTuner.  OpenTuner, which is located in the file `OpenTuner/LICENSE.txt`, is governed by
a license that is provided in that same directory.  All other content in the repository is governed by the license in
`HLS_tuner/LICENSE`.

## Installation
The tuner requires Python 2.  Version 2.7.5 worked great for me.  All required packages are described in
`requirements.txt`.  I installed them in a virtual environment using `virtualenv` version 15.1.0.  That should be
sufficient to run the tuner, which is located at `HLS_tuner/hlstuner/hls_tuner.py`.

## Debugging
Debugging is rather time-consuming if you have to wait for builds to complete.  Hence, the tuner has an option
`--use-prebuilt` to reuse an old build, which is located in the `Prebuilt` directory.  The option will replace the
latency with a number from a artificial design space, useful for debugging the surrogate models.

## Graphs
Graphs were plot using the Jupyter that is part of Anaconda 2019.03.  The notebooks can be found in the `Notebook`.
Directories are hardcoded, and some tuner sources have changed since I last ran some of the scripts, so you will likely
encounter some issues when running this code.
