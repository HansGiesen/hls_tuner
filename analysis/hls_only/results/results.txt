  Run of pragma tuner developed at Xilinx on Cholesky decomposition without unsafe math optimizations and without
  skip_exit_check.  We tune only the unrolling of the innermost loop.  The arrays are not partitioned.  Based on code
  in commit 18145aa2fea109fa8776299637cfe52903234318.  Used combined model with Gaussian process and prior model.

  Run of pragma tuner developed at Xilinx on Cholesky decomposition with unsafe math optimizations and with
  skip_exit_check.  We tune the unrolling of the innermost loop and partitioning of the L_internal array with the same
  design parameter.  Based on code in commit a43642ba4be884fda5192accebbc640d8ac51cfc.  Used combined model with
  Gaussian process and prior model.
